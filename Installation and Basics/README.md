### Use the Anaconda Prompt to install prerequisites for NLP Learning Environment
```bash
cd <SourcePath>
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nlplearnenv
jupyter notebook
```

# Machine Learning Basics

In my words, automated way to find hidden patterns from historical data and with that it arrives decisions for the present or future. Since we are much focused in text processing here, let see some examples related to that scenario

Examples - Text Classification, Topic modeling, Text Sentiment analysis, Entity extraction, Machine translation.

Two Types

1) Supervised Learning
   -- Labeled Data - Means for each set of input we already knows the desired outcome is
   
   For Example - Text classification by topic, Postive vs negative movie review
   --to be continued
